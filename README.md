# AlienWhoopF7 ELRS
This project is forked from [Brucesdad13's AlienWhoopF7 Project](https://github.com/brucesdad13/AlienWhoopF7). I wanted to modify the project a bit and add some additional features.

# AlienWhoopF7 ELRS Features
Besides the already mentioned features in the original project page, here are some of the features I have added. I focused this project only on the F7 board (F4 is no longer supported on this board).

* ExpressLRS 2.4 GHz CCG Receiver incorporated into the PCB. No more worrying about range (or latency)
* Added OSD support
* VTx Control pads
* 4 Addressable LEDs incorporated

* Note: external receiver is NO LONGER required. You only need a compatible ELRS 2.4GHz Transmitter.

Recomended by original creators is 0.8mm 2oz Copper ENIG (gold) finish purple PCBs from OSH Park

Deep bows of appreciation and thanks to Lance for his original work and tremendous
generosity in releasing his labor of love for the benefit of all flight controller
enthusiasts. Check out AlienWhoop's ancestry in our preserved copy of Lance's original AlienFlight
github repository of open source hardware flight controllers: the [Classic FC aka Classic Narrow](https://github.com/brucesdad13/AlienFlightArchive/blob/master/Flight-Controllers/Classic#narrow-classic-flight-controller), [F3 Quad FC](https://github.com/brucesdad13/AlienFlightArchive/blob/master/Flight-Controllers/F3-V1/F3-Quad#f3-quad-brushed-v1-flight-controller), [F3 Hexa FC](https://github.com/brucesdad13/AlienFlightArchive/blob/master/Flight-Controllers/F3-V1/F3-Hexa#f3-hexa-brushed-v1-flight-controller), and [F3 Octo FC](https://github.com/brucesdad13/AlienFlightArchive/blob/master/Flight-Controllers/F3-V1/F3-Octo#f3-octo-brushed-v1-flight-controller).
*As of late July 2017, the original www.alienflight.com site is no longer in operation.

Equally deep bows to Jesse Perkins, creator of Tiny Whoop, and the source of inspiration and love for tiny brushed quads.

~ Please note: **AlienWhoop** is not affiliated with nor endorsed by AlienFlight or forks of Lance's work such as AlienFlight NG. The use of Alien in the name and the alien head vector graphic used on the board silkscreen are nods to the lineage of this remix and to the work of Lance and others who created the conditions for this project to arise. Likewise, AlienWhoop is not affiliated with nor endorsed by Tiny Whoop. The Whoop in the name comes from Jesse Perkin's fantastic Tiny Whoop ("a small first-person-view aircraft that truly allows you to feel the gift of flight and the feeling of being tiny" [tinywhoop.com]) and is simply a nod to his efforts and the TW community worldwide.
